Spam Detection using Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm

Run this code using:-

<code>
$ python spamRF.py  
</code>

english.txt and english_big.txt are spam dataset.
Using these two datasets and spam.py, I've made a new dataset spam.csv which consists of 9 columns.

spamRF.py is used to apply machine learning on spam.csv.
